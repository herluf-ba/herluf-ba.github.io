      <h1>Making a turn-based multiplayer game in Rust - What's a turn-based game anyway? (part 1/3)</h1>
      <blockquote>
<p>This is part 1 of 3 in a tutorial series about making a turn-based online multiplayer game in Rust. In this series we will be building a small game called TicTacTussle. This post descripes what we are trying to achieve, and presents a way to design our code to support that. In the <a href="https://herluf-ba.github.io/making-a-turn-based-multiplayer-game-in-rust-02-game-logic-and-server">second post</a> we will write the server and game-logic and in the <a href="https://herluf-ba.github.io/making-a-turn-based-multiplayer-game-in-rust-03-writing-a-client-using-bevy">third and final post</a> we will write a client for the game using the awesome Bevy game engine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Welcome! I am currently working on a casual online card game called Habitat. For this, I have had to think long and hard about how I wanted to approach networking in my game, and I think I have come up with a pretty solid solution (famous last words). So, for the good of all of us, I have decided to describe this solution in a tutorial series! </p>
<p>To convince you that this pattern is actually nice to work with, we will be building a tic-tac-toe clone called TicTacTussle. In this post, I will go into detail about what I mean by &quot;turn-based&quot; and theorize about how we can do networking when working on turn-based games. I&#39;m assuming you are familiar with Rust, what a server and a client are, and the rules for tic tac toe. If you aren&#39;t, you could just try to follow along anyway, I&#39;m sure you would get most of it 😉</p>
<p>First off, we should get into what characterizes a &quot;turn-based game&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="what-games-are-turn-based-">What games are &quot;turn-based&quot;?</h2>
<p>Turn-based games are games where a group of players plays the game by performing a <em>sequence of actions</em> that advance the game. Usually, only a single player has the ability to perform actions at a time. We can think of a <em>turn</em> as a group of one or more actions that, once performed, hands over the privilege of performing actions from one player to another. A large group of games that fit this description is of course board games, like Monopoly, Uno or a favorite of mine <a href="https://www.daysofwonder.com/tickettoride/en/usa/">Ticket to Ride</a>. </p>
<p>A very important trait of what we will call &quot;turn-based&quot; is that <strong>the state of the game can be determined solely from a sequence of actions</strong>. This trait has some nice consequences that we will be exploiting once we start writing code. To get familiar with these derived consequences, let&#39;s consider an example from one of the OG turn-based games: Chess ♟</p>
<p><img src="../images/turn-based/chess-position.webp" alt="A position in a game of chess"></p>
<p>Let&#39;s say we wanted to save the state of the board in the picture above. Well that&#39;s fairly straightforward, we could just do something like</p>

<pre><code class="lang-rust">enum Piece {
  // White pawn, bishop, knight, rook, queen and king 
  WP, WB, WN, WR, WQ, WK,
  // Black pawn, bishop, knight, rook, queen and king 
  BP, BB, BN, BR, BQ, BK
}

struct Board(Vec&lt;Vec&lt;Option&lt;Piece&gt;&gt;&gt;);

let the_board_from_the_image = {
  use Piece::*;
  Board(vec![
    vec![Some(BR), None,     None,     Some(BQ), Some(BK), Some(BB), None,     Some(BR)],
    vec![Some(BP), Some(BB), Some(BP), Some(BN), None,     Some(BP), Some(BP), Some(BP)],
    vec![None,     Some(BP), None,     None,     None,     None,     None,     None   ],
    vec![None,     None,     None,     Some(BP), None,     None,     Some(WB), None   ],
    vec![None,     None,     None,     Some(WP), None,     None,     None,     None   ],
    vec![Some(WP), None,     None,     None,     None,     Some(WN), None,     None   ],
    vec![None,     Some(WP), Some(WQ), None,     Some(WP), Some(WP), Some(WP), Some(WP)],
    vec![Some(WR), None,     None,     None,     Some(WK), Some(WB), None,     Some(WR)],
  ])
};
</code></pre>
<p>How could we synchronize a game of chess between players playing online? A naive approach would be to just have a server receive moves from each player, calculate a new Board based on that move and then send this new Board to both players. That would work, and honestly, you could probably make a game with that approach as long as the size of the game&#39;s state, ie. the Board struct, isn&#39;t too large.</p>
<p>A more efficient, and frankly straight up cooler, solution is to just have the server send the <em>move the player performs</em> rather than the state. Because <em>the game state can be determined from a sequence of actions</em>, the players themselves can determine the most recent board. This way the messages between the server and players become something like <code>GameEvent::MovePiece { piece: Piece::Rook, position: &quot;a4&quot; }</code> rather than <code>*entire board with all the pieces*</code>, which almost always is way smaller!</p>
<p>In fact, this approach of thinking about a game state as a <em>sequence of actions</em> is so useful that it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess">adopted by chess players</a>) to describe a game of chess around 1847(!). This was of course way before the internet, so the reduced bandwidth usage might not have been too interesting to these guys. Although one can imagine the painstaking task of drawing each board of a game of chess if you were writing a book trying to explain your favorite openings. The image shown above is from a game between Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov and that entire game can be described by these moves (<em>chef&#39;s kiss ~ mwaaah</em>)</p>

<p>Some other less obvious consequences of thinking about game states as sequences of actions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&#39;s fairly straightforward to implement undo and redo functionality. Just pop or push actions onto the sequence.</li>
<li>Saving and loading games can be done by simply saving and loading the sequence of actions.</li>
<li>Having the actions players perform in the game, given a particular sequence of previous actions is <em>very useful</em> if we want to train a machine learning algorithm to add interesting bots to our games. </li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we have established &quot;turn-based games&quot; as games that can be thought of as a <em>sequence of actions</em>, let&#39;s start thinking about how to design our code around this.</p>
<h2 id="a-pattern-for-online-turn-based-games">A pattern for online turn-based games</h2>
<p>The overall problem we are trying to solve is to have the server and the players agree on the state of the game. One solution to this problem is to use the incredibly useful <strong>reducer</strong> pattern, sometimes referred to as the &quot;event pattern&quot; or the <a href="https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/command.html">&quot;command pattern&quot;</a>. At its core it&#39;s super simple: </p>
<p><strong>A <em>reducer</em> is a function that takes a state and an event and produces a new state</strong></p>
<p>Already sounds familiar right? Events are just what we have been calling actions up until now. Events are what the players and server are going to use to communicate with each other. The &quot;state&quot; is, well, the state of our game! Both the server and all players will hold their own version of the game state and both will use the same reducer function to update these states when they receive events. </p>
<p>Using this pattern also lets us address the issue of cheating fairly easily. We will just have the server determine if the event a player is trying to add to the game state looks valid, before sending it to all players. Such a simple way to <strong>reduce</strong> cheating to zero in our game (pun intended).</p>
<p>So the game will progress like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Player sends event to the server</li>
<li>The server inspects the event and verifies that it is valid and allowed</li>
<li>The server updates its own state using the reducer function</li>
<li>The server sends the valid event to all players</li>
<li>Each player uses the reducer function to update their states</li>
<li>Either someone has won or we go to 1. </li>
</ol>
<p>Here&#39;s a visual representation for those of us that, like me, learn best when there are nice colors involved:</p>
<p><img src="../images/turn-based/update-state.gif" alt="An illustration of how the game progresses"></p>
<p>Now let&#39;s look at how we could implement the reducer pattern in rust!</p>
<h2 id="how-do-we-write-a-reducer-in-rust-">How do we write a reducer in Rust?</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s start with something very simple to build upon:</p>

<pre><code class="lang-rust">use std::collections::HashMap;

type PlayerId = u64;

#[derive(Default)]
pub struct GameState {
    // Storing players in a map makes it easy to look them up by id.
    // For now we just store the player name.
    pub players: HashMap&lt;PlayerId, String&gt;,
    // This is all the events that have been added to this state
    // (What we have been calling the &quot;sequence of events&quot;)
    // Useful for undo/redo, but also for debugging!
    history: Vec&lt;GameEvent&gt;,
}

// For now we will just have a single event type: A PlayerJoined event.
#[derive(Clone)]
pub enum GameEvent {
    PlayerJoined { player_id: PlayerId, name: String },
}

fn main() {
    let game_state = GameState::default();
    let event = GameEvent::PlayerJoined { 
        player_id: 1234, 
        name: &quot;Garry K.&quot;.to_string() 
    };
}
</code></pre>
<p>Okay, that&#39;s good but right now we can really only initialize <code>GameState</code>s and <code>GameEvents</code>. We should add a way to make them interact with each other. Let&#39;s add the reduce function!</p>

<pre><code class="lang-rust">use std::collections::HashMap;

type PlayerId = u64;

#[derive(Default)]
pub struct GameState {
    pub players: HashMap&lt;PlayerId, String&gt;,
    history: Vec&lt;GameEvent&gt;,
}

#[derive(Clone)]
pub enum GameEvent {
    PlayerJoined { player_id: PlayerId, name: String },
}

impl GameState {
    /// Aggregates an event into the GameState. 
    pub fn reduce(&amp;mut self, event: &amp;GameEvent) {
        use GameEvent::*;
        match event {
            PlayerJoined { player_id, name } =&gt; {
                self.players.insert(*player_id, name.to_string());
            }
        }

        self.history.push(event.clone());
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut game_state = GameState::default();
    let event = GameEvent::PlayerJoined { 
        player_id: 1234, 
        name: &quot;Garry K.&quot;.to_string() 
    };
    game_state.reduce(&amp;event);
}
</code></pre>
<p>That&#39;s nice, we now have a way to add events to the <code>GameState</code> 👌 An issue we still haven&#39;t addressed is validating events before adding them blindly to the <code>GameState</code>. We could do that like this:</p>

<pre><code class="lang-rust">use std::collections::HashMap;

type PlayerId = u64;

#[derive(Default)]
pub struct GameState {
    pub players: HashMap&lt;PlayerId, String&gt;,
    history: Vec&lt;GameEvent&gt;,
}

#[derive(Clone)]
pub enum GameEvent {
    PlayerJoined { player_id: PlayerId, name: String },
}

impl GameState {
    /// Aggregates an event into the GameState. 
    /// Note that the event is assumed to be valid when passed to reduce
    fn reduce(&amp;mut self, valid_event: &amp;GameEvent) {
        use GameEvent::*;
        match valid_event {
            PlayerJoined { player_id, name } =&gt; {
                self.players.insert(*player_id, name.to_string());
            }
        }

        self.history.push(valid_event.clone());
    }

    /// Determines if the event is valid on the current GameState
    pub fn validate(&amp;self, event: &amp;GameEvent) -&gt; bool {
        use GameEvent::*;
        // In this match statement we try our best to invalidate the event
        match event {
            PlayerJoined { player_id, name: _ } =&gt; {
                if self.players.contains_key(player_id) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }

        // If we can&#39;t find something thats wrong 
        // with the event then it must be ok
        true
    }

    /// Tries to consume an event by first validating it
    pub fn dispatch(&amp;mut self, event: &amp;GameEvent) -&gt; Result&lt;(), ()&gt; {
        // It&#39;s very common to have a &quot;dispatching&quot; function 
        // like this to do things like validation and logging
        if !self.validate(event) {
            return Err(());
        }

        self.reduce(event);
        Ok(())        
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut game_state = GameState::default();
    let event = GameEvent::PlayerJoined { 
        player_id: 1234, 
        name: &quot;Garry K.&quot;.to_string() 
    };

    // 👍 This is accepted like before
    game_state.dispatch(&amp;event).unwrap(); 
    // 🙅‍♂️ This one is rejected since the same player can&#39;t join twice!
    game_state.dispatch(&amp;event).unwrap(); 
}
</code></pre>
<p>Awesome! Now we have something that both the players and the server could use to make sure they have the same state when sending around <code>GameEvent</code>s to each other ✨ </p>
<h2 id="what-s-next-">What&#39;s next?</h2>
<p>In the next one, we will first set up a Rust workspace to make it easy to share code between the server and client. Then we will adapt our <code>GameState</code> implementation into a library that the server can use and finally we will write a working server using the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/renet">renet crate</a>. </p>
